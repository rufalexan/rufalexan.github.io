## Profile

I am a physical and theoretical chemist working at the interface of astrochemistry,
molecular spectroscopy, and data-driven chemical network science.
My research focuses on understanding how molecular complexity emerges and evolves
in astrophysical environments, combining high-resolution experiments,
computational modeling, and FAIR data infrastructures.

## Research

A central contribution of my work is the development of data-driven chemical
network approaches for high-dimensional astrochemical data.
These methods move beyond target-based molecule lists and allow chemical
complexity, reaction pathways, and molecular diversity to be quantified
across laboratory, space-mission, and telescope datasets.

My work integrates laboratory spectroscopy, mass spectrometry,
quantum chemistry, and graph-based analytics to build predictive models
of chemical evolution in interstellar and planetary environments.

## FAIR Data & Open Science

I actively develop FAIR-compliant data and software infrastructures
for astrochemistry and molecular spectroscopy, enabling reproducible,
machine-readable, and interoperable chemical knowledge.
My research group integrates experimental data, computational results,
and network models into open and reusable scientific resources.
